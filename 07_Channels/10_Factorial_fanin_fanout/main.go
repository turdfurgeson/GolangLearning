/*
CHALLENGE #1:
-- Change the code above to execute 1,000 factorial computations concurrently and in parallel.
-- Use the "fan out / fan in" pattern

CHALLENGE #2:
WATCH MY SOLUTION BEFORE DOING THIS CHALLENGE #2
-- While running the factorial computations, try to find how much of your resources are being used.
-- Post the percentage of your resources being used to this discussion: https://goo.gl/BxKnOL
